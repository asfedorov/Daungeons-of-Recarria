## Welcome to Dungeons of Recarria

This project started as a workshow for students 'how you can make a game in python'.
It covered not much: working with databases, OOP, generationg simple map, drawing and moving around in cocos2d-python.

Eventually it developed in something bigger.

**Current goal**:
 1. Make transitions between floors (up and down)
 2. Move map generations to server side
 3. Update logic to server-client, authorization, saving progress, etc...
 4. Create real cutomaizable character object
 5. Beautify map


After it is completed I will move to actual gameplay.
